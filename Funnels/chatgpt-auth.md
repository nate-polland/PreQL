# ChatGPT Authentication Funnel

Users arriving at CK content embedded in ChatGPT start unauthenticated. They must complete a registration or login flow to see their personalized data.

## Completion Anchor

**Primary (recommended):** BigEvent `content_screen IN ('link-chatgpt', 'link-mcp')`, `system_eventType = 2`, `system_eventCode = 'agreeClick'`

**Secondary (unreliable):** `service_bus_streaming_etl.usermanagement_opt_in_etl` where `data.consentInfo.product = 'ChatGPTConsent'` and `data.consentInfo.consentAction = 'Consented'`. Caveat: this table has irregular volume patterns (zero-volume days followed by spikes), suggesting batch writes rather than real-time tracking. Timestamp may reflect write time, not event time. Use BigEvent as the anchor instead.

## Entry Point

`seamless-registration` with `request_refUrl LIKE '%creditkarma.com/signup/chatgpt%'` — validated as the consistent first screen across all user types.

## Session Stitching (Cross-Auth)

Users start unauthenticated — early funnel events have NULL `user_dwNumericId`. No single ID reliably stitches the full session; use IDs in combination:

**Session stitching definition:**
1. **Within a single auth state:** use `user_traceId` (0 collisions — perfectly 1:1 to numericId)
2. **Across auth boundary or page reloads:** use `user_cookieId`, but only where `cookieId` maps to exactly 1 `numericId`. Exclude the 0.1% of cookieIds with 2+ numericIds (shared device / browser reset) or apply timestamp disambiguation.
3. **Recommended query pattern:** find completers via `agreeClick` → get their `cookieId` → filter to cookieIds with `COUNT(DISTINCT numericId) = 1` → pull all events on that cookieId within the session window

**ID coverage on funnel entry events** (validated Mar 10):
| ID | Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `user_traceId` | 100% | **Cleanest 1:1 key** — 0 of 1,722 traces map to multiple numericIds. Reliable within a single auth state; changes at page reloads and at authentication. |
| `user_cookieId` | 100% | Persists across traceId changes and auth boundary — use to bridge pre-auth TOS (`termsContinue`) to post-auth `agreeClick`. **Caveat: 2 of 1,720 cookies (0.1%) map to 2 numericIds** (shared device / browser reset). Validate 1:1 before using as stitch for a specific user. Validated: same cookieId across all 4 traceIds in a 6.5-min new-user session. |
| `user_deviceId` | 100% | Cross-checked: same result as cookieId (6 users tested) |
| `user_dwNumericId` | 20% | Auth-only, expected for unauth start |
| `glid` | 2% | Auth-only — do NOT use for this stitch |

## Session Window

User-estimated: 5–10 minutes. Current buffer: 15 minutes from first `seamless-registration` event. Not yet empirically validated — longest observed session in sample was 7.5 minutes (account recovery failure).

## User Types

Four distinct paths through this funnel, determined by recognition at different stages:

1. **Returning — recognized at OTP** — existing CK account with verified phone. After OTP verify, system recognizes them and skips PII entirely → straight to completion (`link-chatgpt`/`link-mcp`). **This is the majority path (~4,900 of ~7,400 completers).**

2. **Returning — recognized at Prove (no TOS)** — PII submitted, Prove API matches to existing account. Skips TOS and login → straight to completion. No intermediate auth screen.

3. **Returning — PII match → login redirect** — PII submitted, matched but requires login. Routed to `login-web-redirect` → password/2FA/recovery screens. Includes UMP sub-path (`ump-phone-verify` → `ump-enter-otc`) for password-disabled accounts.

4. **New users** — no CK account. PII → Prove → TOS acceptance (`termsContinue`) → new account created → completion. TOS fires pre-auth on a different traceId — stitch via cookieId.

## Validated User Paths (Mar 10–12 + enrichment Mar 17)

### Returning — Recognized at OTP (majority path)
`seamless-registration` (phone → OTP) → `link-chatgpt`/`link-mcp` (agreeClick)
No PII step. System recognizes the phone number and skips straight to consent. ~4,900 of ~7,400 completers.

### Returning — Prove Success (no TOS)
`seamless-registration` (shortPersonalInfo → PII submit) → Prove API matches → `link-chatgpt` (agreeClick)
No login redirect, no auth screens. Backend Prove matches identity and skips TOS. Validated for 2/3 SRRF prove-success returning users.

### Returning — PII Match → Login Redirect
`seamless-registration` (shortPersonalInfo) → `login-web-redirect` → `login-password-options` (submit) → `link-chatgpt` (agreeClick)

### Returning — UMP (password-disabled)
`seamless-registration` → `login-web-redirect` → `login-unknown-password-disabled-text` → `ump-phone-verify` → `ump-enter-otc` → `link-chatgpt` (agreeClick)
UMP is inside login-web-redirect, not a parallel entry branch.

### Returning — Forced 2FA (rare, valid)
`seamless-registration` → `login-web-redirect` → `login-password-options` → `force-2fa-phone-check` → `force-2fa-new-phone` → `force-2fa-verify-email-otc` → `force-2fa-verify-new-phone-otc` → `link-chatgpt` (agreeClick)

### New User — Prove Success → TOS → Account Created
`seamless-registration` (shortPersonalInfo) → Prove API → `termsContinue` (pre-auth, diff traceId) → new account created → `link-chatgpt`/`link-mcp` (agreeClick)
Stitch via cookieId across auth boundary.

### MCP 2FA Enrolled
`seamless-registration` → OTP → `link-mcp-twofa-enrolled` (continueClick) → `login-web-redirect` → auth screens → completion

### Identity Match Failure (drops off)
`seamless-registration` (matchFailedReturn) → `reg-step-1` → `login-unknown` → `login-unknown-password-disabled-text` → phone/email OTC attempts → **drop**
Also reachable via Prove fail retry: prove fail → user retries PII → matchFailedReturn → same recovery flow.

### TOS Match Failure (rare — ~16 in 90 days)
`seamless-registration` → Prove → `termsContinue` → termsSubmitError + matchFailedReturn → `reg-step-1` → login flow → **mostly drop**

### Account Recovery Loop (rare, drops off)
`seamless-registration` → `login-web-redirect` → `login-unknown-step-1-dup` → `recovery-newphone-phone` ↔ `recovery-newphone-code` (repeated failures) → `login-acct-look-up` → `login-verification-option` → **drop** or loop back to start

## Screens Outside Funnel Scope

The following screens appear in the ChatGPT refUrl cohort but are **not part of the auth funnel** — they are return visits or post-completion app screens that occur days to months after the original funnel session:

| Screen | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| `link-anywhere` | Post-completion return visit |
| `login-seamless-ck-brandshake` | Post-completion return visit |
| `login-email-auth-factor` | Post-completion return visit |
| `signup` | Post-completion return visit |

## Key Funnel Timing (from entry point forward)
- 0 sec: `seamless-registration` (phone entry)
- ~5–20 sec: OTP verification
- ~20–85 sec: shortPersonalInfo / PII match (if needed)
- ~48–95 sec: Login redirect + password (returning users)
- ~60–85 sec: 2FA flow (if forced)
- ~80–170 sec: Recovery loops (if account recovery needed)
- Up to 450 sec (7.5 min): Extreme recovery cases before drop-off

## Open Questions
- **✅ RESOLVED — New-user TOS screen** — `termsContinue` DOES fire in BigEvent within `seamless-registration`, but **pre-auth on a different traceId** than the completion event. A new traceId is created at authentication — stitch via `cookieId` to connect pre-auth TOS to post-auth `agreeClick`. Also trackable via SRRF `completed_toa = 1`, validated against `matchedMembers.validationTs` at 94%.
- **✅ RESOLVED — `regLog_account_created` is an inverted flag** — `1` = failure, `0` = success. Validated across all affiliates: `account_created=0` + `completed_toa=1` matches matchedMembers at 92%; `account_created=1` matches at <1%. The 74 OpenAI users with `account_created=1` were account creation failures, not successes. Use `completed_toa=1` AND `regLog_account_created=0` as the new-user completion definition.
- Session window (15 min) not yet empirically validated — max observed: 7.5 min (account recovery). Buffer appears adequate.
- Forced 2FA and recovery paths confirmed across 3 days (2 sessions each) but still low volume
- `regLog_ssn_lookup_success` and `regLog_report_pull_creditfreeze` — suspected inverted flags (same `regLog_` prefix pattern as the confirmed-inverted `regLog_account_created`). Not yet validated against ground truth.

## Cohort Analysis

### Methodology

Users are classified by **first observable signal** — the earliest step that reveals identity status. Classification is propagated backward using a **uniform dropout assumption**: pre-classification drop-off at each step is assumed equal across cohorts, absent data to the contrary. Drops at classified steps are allocated proportionally to the cohort mix at that step.

**Stated assumptions:**
1. Pre-classification dropout is uniform across cohorts at each step
2. Cohort mix at the first-signal step is applied as the prior for unclassified droppers at earlier steps
3. Prove outcome is the classification event for PII-path users (outcomes: phone match → skip PII, PII/cred match, or new user)

**Anchor step:** OTP Submit — **10,429 users** (Jan 1–Mar 17 2026). Last step where all users share a common path before any forking.

**Denominator methodology:** Each step uses its *previous step* as the denominator for conditional %. Multiply through the chain to get % of anchor. Do not use entry as the denominator everywhere.

### Cohort Population and CVR

All numbers query-confirmed (BE cookie-join for Cat1; SRRF `success_prove_call` for Cat3/Cat2 Prove counts). Cohort totals include allocated drops.

| Cohort | Classified | Allocated drops | Total | % of anchor | Completions | CVR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔵 Phone match | 6,923 | — | 6,923 | **66.4%** | 5,795 | **83.7%** |
| 🟠 PII/cred match | 1,234 | 1,685 | 2,919 | **28.0%** | 1,579 | **54.1%** |
| 🟢 New user | 116 | 504 | 620 | **5.9%** | 114 | **18.4%** (98.3% from TOS) |
| **Total** | **8,273** | **2,189** | **10,462** | **100.3%** ✓ | **7,488** | **71.8%** |

**Drop allocation:** PII-path drops (silent bounces + Prove fails) split at Cat2=75.9% / Cat3=24.1% — the observed mix of classifiable PII users (365 Cat2 + 116 Cat3 = 481 total).

**Validation:** 66.4% × 83.7% + 28.0% × 54.1% + 5.9% × 18.4% = 55.6 + 15.1 + 1.1 = **71.8% = 7,488/10,429** ✓

### Interpretation

- 🔵 Phone-match users convert at **83.7%** — benchmark for a frictionless auth path
- 🟠 PII/cred-match users convert at **54.1%** — 29 points lower due to PII form friction
- 🟢 New users convert from TOS at **98.3%** but represent only 5.9% of the funnel; the 18.4% from-anchor rate reflects heavy pre-TOS drop-off
- The PII path (Cat2 + Cat3 = 33.9%) accounts for ~46% of total drop-off — primary optimization target
